"""Estate feature-compatibility checker — enforces the additive-feature rule.

Cargo unifies features **graph-wide**: if any crate in a consumer's dependency
graph enables `dep/feat`, every crate in that graph is compiled with it. A
crate that is correct under its own `--all-features` build can therefore still
fail to compile inside a host that enables a *different* feature set.

The unsound shape is a public API element whose existence depends on a
feature:

    #[cfg(feature = "timeout")]
    Timeout,                      // a new variant breaks every host `match`
                                  // that was exhaustive before unification

This checker finds those elements at the source, statically, before they reach
a consumer. It is the prevention gate; a downstream unification build is only
the detection.

Rules (see docs/feature-compatibility.md):

    R1  feature-gated variant of a public enum
    R2  feature-gated field of a public struct that is not #[non_exhaustive]
    R3  feature-gated match arm
    R4  feature-gated required method of a public trait (no default body)
    R5  suppression without a reason

Suppression: a line above or on the offending line may carry

    // feature-compat: allow — <non-empty reason>

A suppression with an empty reason is itself reported (R5): the estate does
not accept undocumented escape hatches.

Usage:

    python3 check-features.py --cwd .
    python3 check-features.py --cwd . --json
    python3 check-features.py --cwd . --rule R1 --rule R2

Pure stdlib. No third-party deps, nothing to install in kit repos.
