# Clone or update the estate into one directory, so path dependencies resolve.
#
# The estate is path-linked: no crate in it is published to crates.io, so a crate can only
# find its siblings if they are on disk beside it. That works fine for someone with the
# estate already checked out, and fails for anyone who clones a single repository, because
# cargo says only `no matching package named X` with no hint that the answer is to clone
# the neighbours.
#
# This script is that answer. It clones every crate named in the estate registry, checks
# them out beside each other, and then verifies that each one resolves its dependencies.
# It is idempotent: running it again updates what is already there.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/bootstrap.sh [DESTINATION]
#
# DESTINATION defaults to a directory beside this script's parent, which is where the
# estate is normally kept. Pass somewhere else to put a second copy.
